During the last two years I found myself having to interview a lot of people. Mindful of some bad experiences in the past, I promised myself to do my best: I wanted the people interviewed to feel comfortable talking to me.

What would I recommend to myself from two years ago?

## 1. Do not put the candidate in trouble

- First thing: **be kind**.

- **No to brain-teasing questions**, but yes to challenging questions. What's the point of asking how many golf balls can fit in a bus? Propose a small *refactoring* or algorithmic exercise to solve together.

- Try to **drive to the solution**: ask follow-up questions, but figure out when to stop.

## 2. Know who's in front of you

- **Be prepared**: do your homework and prepare for the interview, get to know the candidate through his resume, his Linkedin, Github, ...

- **Show interest**. Try quoting something you liked about the CV or a project on Github. 

## 3. Represent your company

- Remember that the candidate is also forming an idea about the company, and **you are representing it**.

- **Sell the brand**: each candidate is a potential customer of yours.

## 4. Don't act like a hotshot

- You're not the greatest expert at everything, and it's perfectly okay. Take each interview as an opportunity to learn (especially when you talk to people with much more experience).

- Take notes of what you discuss during the interview: your memory sucks!

## 5. Improve everyday

- Do **shadowing** as much as you can! Learn from other interviewers, join their interviews and make them join yours. Ask for their feedbacks.

- **Fight the bias**. The worst thing that can happen is to have a group of similar people working together. Diversity opens the mind!

## Conclusion

These are the advice I would have liked to have received at the beginning of my adventure as an interviewer. But the road to perfection is still a long one. If you have advice to share with me, contact me!
